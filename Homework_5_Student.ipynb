One of the other guests was algae scientist Dr. Muriel Bristol, who refused a cup of tea from Fisher because he put milk in first BEFORE pouring the tea. Bristol was convinced she could taste the difference, and much preferred the taste of tea where the milk was poured in afterwards. Fisher didn't think that there could be a difference and proposed a hypothesis test to examine the situation.\n",

    "Fisher made 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk in first and 4 with tea in first, and gave them to Dr. Bristol without her seeing how they were made and she would say if she thought the tea or the milk was poured first.  As it turned out, Dr. Bristol correctly identified if the tea or milk was poured first for all 8 of the cups. Fisher, being a skeptical statistician wanted to test if this could be happening by chance with Bristol just randomly guessing (or whether it seemed more likely that Bristol was not guessing). \n",

    "A criminal court considers two opposing claims about a defendant: they are either innocent or guilty. In the Canadian legal system, the role of the prosecutor is to present convincing evidence that the defendant is not innocent.  Lawyers for the defendant attempt to argue that the evidence is *not convincing enough* to rule out that the defendant could be innocent.  If there is not enough evidence to convict the defendant and they are set free, the judge generally does not deliver a verdict of \"innocent\", but rather of \"not guilty\". "
