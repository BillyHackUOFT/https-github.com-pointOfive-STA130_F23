The researchers used a birth registry of all children born in Ontario in 2018, which included approximately 130,000 births. The researchers found that 0.6% of mothers reported that their babies have developmental disabilities and 56% of babies born to mothers who consumed alcohol at least once during pregnancy. In contrast, 55% of healthy babies were born to mothers who were not exposed to alcohol. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.50.\n",

    "(c) A group of researchers wanted to find out whether completing a degree in Statistics is a worthy inverstment for an individual. They conducted a survey of graduates from the University of Toronto and included 1,000 recent graduates who completed their Bachelor’s degree in the last five years in the study; 80% of the respondents were female and 20% were male.The median reported income of a UofT graduate was \\\\$76,000. Among statistics graduates, the median reported income was \\\\$84,000. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.014.\n",

    "(d) A team of researchers were interested in understanding millennial’s views regarding housing affordability in Toronto. The team interviewed 850 millennials currently living in Toronto. 84% reported that they felt housing prices were unaffordable in the city. Suppose the researchers were interested in testing whether this proportion was different from a study published last year, which found that 92% of millennials reported that housing costs were unaffordable. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.023.\n",

    "(e) Suppose a drug company was interested in testing a new weight-loss drug. They enrolled 20,000 participants and assigned 10,000 to take their new drug, SlimX, and 10,000 to take a placebo. The researchers found that over 2 months, participants who took SlimX lost, on average, 5 lbs. In comparison, the control group lost 4.5 lbs during the same time. The researchers reported a p-value of <0.0001."
