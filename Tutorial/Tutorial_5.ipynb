    "Stella McStat had been running a small-time gambling operation on campus for several months during her first year at U of T. It was disrupted during COVID, but now that vaccines are mandatory to be on campus, Stella is getting things back up and running.\n",

    "\n",
    "The format: For each spin of the wheel, two gamblers take part. For a toonie each ($2 Canadian), Stella sells one a red ticket and one a black ticket  (i.e., total $4). Then Stella spins the Wheel of Destiny. The person who holds the colour on which the spinner stops gets $3.50 (Stella keeps $0.50 per spin for running the game and providing snacks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stella just bought a new spinner, the critical piece of equipment for this game. She's heard some mixed reviews about the manufacturer she has purchased from. Before she beings using this spinner, she wants to make sure that it is, in fact, fair—she wants both colours to come up equally often. Because of the set-up of the game, Stella has no incentive to cheat and wants the game to be as fair as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything she can examine about the wheel seems fine; there is the same number of sectors of each colour and they each have the same area. BUT! Stella has a great idea and decides to come to YOU, her statistical guru, and ask you to verify that the new spinner is fit to use.\n",

    "You are an amateur data detective that reads studies in your free time and checks whether the researchers conform to academic integrity. Here are some studies that you recently found. Identify the hypotheses (One-Group or Two-Group) of the researchers and describe how you could validate the findings using a simulation test. Make a presentation on your hypothesis test.\n",

    "(a) A health survey asked 200 individuals aged 20-45 living in Toronto to report the number minutes they exercised last week. Researchers were interested in determining whether the average duration of exercise differed between people who consume cannabis and those who do not consume cannabis. Assume the researchers who conducted this study found that people who used cannabis exercised, on average, 20 minutes per week. In contrast, people who did not use cannabis exercised 40 minutes per week, on average. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.249.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) A study was conducted to examine whether a mother's exposure to alcohol while she was pregnant affects the odds of developemntal disabilities. The researchers used a birth registry of all children born in Ontario in 2018, which included approximately 130,000 births. The researchers found that 0.6% of mothers reported that their babies have developmental disabilities and 56% of babies born to mothers who consumed alcohol at least once during pregnancy. In contrast, 55% of healthy babies were born to mothers who were not exposed to alcohol. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.50.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) A group of researchers wanted to find out whether completing a degree in Statistics is a worthy inverstment for an individual. They conducted a survey of graduates from the University of Toronto and included 1,000 recent graduates who completed their Bachelor’s degree in the last five years in the study; 80% of the respondents were female and 20% were male.The median reported income of a UofT graduate was \\\\$76,000. Among statistics graduates, the median reported income was \\\\$84,000. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.014.\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) A team of researchers were interested in understanding millennial’s views regarding housing affordability in Toronto. The team interviewed 850 millennials currently living in Toronto. 84% reported that they felt housing prices were unaffordable in the city. Suppose the researchers were interested in testing whether this proportion was different from a study published last year, which found that 92% of millennials reported that housing costs were unaffordable. The researchers reported a p-value of 0.023.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Suppose a drug company was interested in testing a new weight-loss drug. They enrolled 20,000 participants and assigned 10,000 to take their new drug, SlimX, and 10,000 to take a placebo. The researchers found that over 2 months, participants who took SlimX lost, on average, 5 lbs. In comparison, the control group lost 4.5 lbs during the same time. The researchers reported a p-value of <0.0001."
