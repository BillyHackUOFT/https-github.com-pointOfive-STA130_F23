    "In the analyses above you used a quantiative p-value to provide a qualitative statement of the evidence against the *null hypothesis*. This doesn't necessarily entail a formal decision about a *null hypothesis* (and there are many good reasons to proceed in this manner). However, it would also be possible to make a statement about the *null hypothesis* which should ideally take the form of \"I choose to reject the *null hypothesis* $H_0$ on the basis of the evidence at hand\", or contrarily \"I fail to reject the *null hypothesis*...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In a legal context a court considers the opposing claims that the defendant is either innocent or guilty. In the Canadian legal system, the role of the prosecutor is to present convincing evidence that the defendant is guilty.  Lawyers for the defendant attempt to argue that the evidence is *not convincing enough* to rule out that the defendant could be innocent.  If there is not enough evidence to convict the defendant  the judge generally generally delivers a verdict of \"not guilty\" as opposed to \"innocent\". Phrasing the ruling this way indicates that the burnden of evidence is on the verdict of \"guilty\" and the necessary standard of evidence required to rule \"guilty\" was not met; but, it also simultaneously allows for the understanding that \"innocence\" is not necessarily proven (and that it is not strictly necessarily to ever prove \"innocence\" as part of a ruling of \"not guilty\").
